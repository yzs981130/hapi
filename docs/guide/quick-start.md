# Quick Start

<Steps>

## Install HAPI

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g @twsxtd/hapi --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

```bash [Homebrew]
brew install tiann/tap/hapi
```

```bash [npx (one-off)]
npx @twsxtd/hapi
```

:::

> Recommendation: use the official npm registry for global install. Some mirrors may not sync platform packages in time.

Other install options: [Installation](./installation.md)

## Start the hub

```bash
hapi hub --relay
```

On first run, HAPI prints an access token and saves it to `~/.hapi/settings.json`.

`hapi server` remains supported as an alias.

The terminal will display a URL and QR code for remote access.

> End-to-end encrypted with WireGuard + TLS.

## Start a coding session

```bash
hapi
```

This starts Claude Code wrapped with HAPI. The session appears in the web UI.

## Open the UI

Open the URL shown in the terminal, or scan the QR code with your phone.

Enter your access token to log in.
